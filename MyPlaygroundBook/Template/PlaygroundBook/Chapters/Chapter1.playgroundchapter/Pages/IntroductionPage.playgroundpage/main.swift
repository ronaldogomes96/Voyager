 ## 🖐🏻 Hello inhabitants of Planet Earth! 🌎
 
 Hello, my name is Ronaldo Gomes, I am a student at the Apple Developer Academy and I am majoring in Computer Science at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará.

 I am totally in love with astronomy and that is the theme of this playground. I could talk about countless themes, but what motivates me the most in this subject is the discovery by the new, by the unknown, to go where nothing and nobody went.

 Several ships and missions have accomplished this feat, but none can compare to the Voyager mission. It is simply the object created by humans furthest from the earth, launched over 40 years ago and which continues to advance into the unknown.

 Get ready to meet the longest space mission ever made!
