 # The ship ðŸš€

 Voyagers 1 and 2 are twin ships. Voyager 1 is escaping the solar system at a speed of about 3.5 AU per year and a voyager 2 at 3.1 AU per year. An AU is equivalent to the distance from the sun to the earth that is approximately 150 million kilometers. Both have already left the solar system and entered the so-called interstellar space.

 Soon we cannot have the chance to see the ships up close, except for photos. However, technology can help us. Imagine the opportunity to see one of the voyagers at your home, by your side? This is possible now, in your iPad camera with technology called augmented reality.
 
- Note:
 For a better experience with augmented reality, look for a well-lit place, with space and few objects for a better view of the ship.
