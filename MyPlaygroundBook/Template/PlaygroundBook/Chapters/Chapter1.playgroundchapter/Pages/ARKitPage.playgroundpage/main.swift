 ## The ship

 Voyagers 1 and 2 are twin ships. Voyager 1 is escaping the solar system at a speed of about 3.5 AU per year and a voyager 2 at 3.1 AU per year. An AU is equivalent to the distance from the sun to the earth that is approximately 150 million kilometers. Both have already left the solar system and entered the so-called interstellar space.

 Soon we cannot have the chance to see the ships up close, except for photos. However, technology can help us. Imagine the opportunity to see one of the voyagers at your home, by your side? This is possible now, run the code below and view it on the iPad.
 
 ## Note: For a better experience, look for a bright and spacious place for a better view of the ship

 To know that this same ship is billions of kilometers away is surreal!
